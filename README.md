# E-Stitchbook
The E-stitchbook (estitchbook.pdf) is one of the contributions of the Embr framework. The e-stitchbook formally characterizes 12 electronic embroidery stitches and their corresponding liquid crystal expressions. For each stitch, we showcase a the front and back of the stitch as rendered in the Embr tool, the physical and thermal results as well as the physical, thermal and electrical properties of the stitch. The estitchbook.pdf file can be opened using any pdf viewer.
